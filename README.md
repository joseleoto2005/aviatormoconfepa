## What is the Aviator Game?

Aviator is an innovative crash game where players aim to predict when a
plane will \"crash\" and cash out before it does. The game is known for
its thrilling, fast-paced nature, where every round can end in a big
win---or a significant loss. Players place their bets before the game
starts, and as the plane climbs higher, the multiplier increases. The
key is to cash out before the plane crashes, which can happen at any
moment.
